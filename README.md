## Project Description
The Calmaria Spa landing page is a meticulously crafted front-end project that showcases the spa's offerings through a modern, stylish interface built with HTML, CSS, and SASS. This page is designed to provide a seamless user experience, guiding potential clients through various sections that highlight the spa's services, environment, and special offers. Each section is intuitively designed, featuring interactive elements that enhance user engagement and provide detailed information about the spa's unique aspects.

## Features and Application Demonstration
- **Interactive Dropdown Menu**: Utilizes SASS to create a smooth dropdown experience in the navigation bar. Hovering over the "Our Space" menu item triggers a rotation animation on the arrow and reveals additional clickable options.
- **Dynamic Call to Action Buttons**: Strategically placed throughout the site, these buttons change color on hover and are designed to guide users towards taking actions, such as subscribing or booking a service.
- **Product and Service Cards**: Three distinct cards display key benefits of the spa's services. Each card combines eye-catching design with concise information, providing a quick overview of what the spa offers.
- **Subscription Modal**: An interactive modal confirms subscription success with a visually appealing design and straightforward messaging, enhancing user satisfaction.
- **Contact Us Modal**: Features an accessible contact form within a modal, which appears upon clicking the 'Contact Us' button. The form includes fields for name, email, phone number, and a message, and confirms message delivery with a success modal.
- **Accordion FAQ Section**: Implemented with SASS and JavaScript, this section addresses common queries through a click-to-reveal functionality, where each accordion button expands to show answers and collapses upon re-click.
- **SASS Styling**: Advanced SASS features like nested rules, variables, and mixins are used to create complex, maintainable, and reusable styles that make the site both attractive and efficient in terms of load times.

## Project Access

### Prerequisites
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Ensure you have your preferred IDE installed, such as Visual Studio Code.
- **SASS Installation**: There are two primary methods to use SASS in your projects:
  - **VSCode Live SASS Compiler**: Install the [Live SASS Compiler extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-SASS) for Visual Studio Code. Activate it by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and selecting 'Live SASS: Watch SASS', or clicking the 'Watch SASS' button on the bottom bar. This will compile `.scss` files into `.css` files in real time.
  - **Node.js SASS**: If you prefer using the command line, first install Node.js. Then, install SASS globally using `npm install -g sass`. Verify the installation with `sass --version`.
